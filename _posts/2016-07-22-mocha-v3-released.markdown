title: Mocha v3 released
layout: post
---
This is excited -- a major update of a longstanding testing tool.

Significant changes:

* Due to the increasing difficulty of applying security patches made within its dependency tree, as well as looming incompatibilities with Node.js v7.0, Mocha no longer supports Node.js v0.8.
* `.only()` is no longer "fuzzy", can be used multiple times, and generally just works like you think it should.
* The `dot` reporter now uses more visually distinctive characters when indicating "pending" and "failed" tests.

I've upgraded two repositories at work to Mocha v3. It is working right with the latest Karma and Chai.
